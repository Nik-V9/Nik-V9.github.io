Hello! I'm a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) advised by [Sebastian Scherer](https://theairlab.org/team/sebastian/) & [Deva Ramanan](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~deva/), as a part of the [AirLab](https://theairlab.org/). I'm also currently a Visiting Researcher at [Meta](https://tech.facebook.com/reality-labs/) working with the XR Maps team.

My current research focuses on developing generalizable spatial perception systems for scene understanding and deployment of field robots in the wild. My interests lie at the intersection of geometric computer vision, field robotics, and large-scale semi/self-supervised learning. I have an innate passion for understanding how human perception & navigation works and how we can build real-world deployable autonomous systems with a positive societal impact.

I received a Master's degree in Robotics from [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu/) and a Bachelor's degree in Engineering Physics from [IIT (ISM) Dhanbad, India](https://www.iitism.ac.in/iitismnew/). During my undergrad, I had the pleasure to intern at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) and [QUT Centre for Robotics](https://research.qut.edu.au/qcr/) and was also a [2021 CMU Robotics Institute Summer Scholar](https://riss.ri.cmu.edu/). I'm grateful to have many wonderful mentors and collaborators!

Apart from research, I'm a huge movie buff and find recreation in cooking, music, anime, and gaming.
